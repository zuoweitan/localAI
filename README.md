## Build

It is recommended to build it on linux/wsl. Other platforms are not verified.

**Rust is needed for building tokenizer-cpp. You should first install rustup, then "rustup default stable".**

### Clone this repo recursively

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/xororz/local-dream.git
```

### Prepare SDKs

1. Download [QNN_SDK_2.29](https://apigwx-aws.qualcomm.com/qsc/public/v1/api/download/software/qualcomm_neural_processing_sdk/v2.29.0.241129.zip) and extract
2. Download [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) and extract
3. Modify the QNN_SDK_ROOT in app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt
4. Modify the ANDROID_NDK_ROOT in app/src/main/cpp/CMakePresets.json

### Build and prepare libraries

#### Linux

```bash
cd app/src/main/cpp/
bash ./build.sh
```

#### Windows

```powershell
# winget install Kitware.CMake (install CMake if you don't have it)
# winget install Ninja-build.Ninja (install Ninja if you don't have it)
# winget install Rustlang.Rustup (install Rust if you don't have it)
cd app\src\main\cpp\
# Convert patch file to Unix format (if you don't have dos2unix, install with: winget install -e --id waterlan.dos2unix)
dos2unix SampleApp.patch
.\build.bat
```

## Technical Implementation

### NPU Acceleration

- Utilizes Qualcomm QNN SDK to leverage Hexagon NPU
- W8A16 static quantization for optimal performance
- Fixed model shape at 512x512
- Extremely fast inference speed

### CPU Inference

- Powered by MNN framework
- W8 dynamic quantization
- Flexible output sizes: 128x128, 256x256, 384x384, 512x512
- Relatively slower processing speed with slightly lower accuracy

## Supported Devices

### NPU Acceleration Support

- Devices with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1
- Devices with Snapdragon 8+Gen 1
- Devices with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2
- Devices with Snapdragon 8 Gen 3
- Devices with Snapdragon 8 Elite

**Other devices are not able to download the npu models.**

### CPU Support

- Requires approximately 2GB RAM
- Compatible with most Android phones from recent years

## Seed Settings

The application supports custom seed settings for reproducible results:

- CPU Mode: Seeds guarantee identical results across different devices with the same parameters
- NPU Mode: Seeds ensure consistent results only on devices with identical chipsets
